# redux-cartly
E-commerce site using React, Redux, Express, &amp; PostgreSQL

This is a personal project that I use to sandbox and have fun with. 
This is a fullstack CRUD site that I can try out anything that may not be able to sandbox in a new project.


Setup:

cd frontend
npm install
npm start

cd backend
npm install
nodemon server.js

Tests:
Since I use this to sandbox, I will either TDD the new feature once I get it working in the project I'm actually working on
or properly test it there after implementing it.
